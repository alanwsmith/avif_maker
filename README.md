# AVIF Maker

My tool for converting still images
and mp4 into .avif files to use
on my site. (The idea being to use
the ones generated from the mp4s
as a replacement for GIFs)

## Notes

- Currently hard coded for my local
site builder output. 

## TODO

[] Add watcher

[] Do updates when images change even
if the file name stays the same

[] Warn if multiple source images
have the same name (and therefore
output location)

[] Show timing for images

[] Write to a tmp file and do a rename
to move the final file in place

[x] Make sure rgb and rgba images 
both work

[x] Make a default image output with 
the raw size with no custom name
